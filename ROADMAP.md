# GraphifyCode Development Roadmap

## Project Overview
Interactive tool for analyzing and visualizing microservice architectures using AI agents. Creates interactive maps of codebases with service definitions, endpoints, and inter-service relationships.

## Current Status âœ…
- [x] Project structure and architecture design
- [x] Data models specification (SPEC.md)
- [x] C# models in GraphifyCode.Core
- [x] MCP server foundation with GraphifyCodeTool
- [x] Data access layer (GraphifyCodeDataService)
- [x] First working method: GetServicesOverview()
- [x] Proper DI configuration and settings management
- [x] Repository template with Docker and CI/CD

## Phase 1: Complete MCP Server ðŸš§
**Goal**: Finish all MCP tools for AI agent interaction

### Backend (GraphifyCode.MCP)
- [ ] **GetServiceEndpoints(string serviceName)**
  - Return endpoints for specific service
  - Handle service not found cases

- [ ] **GetServiceRelations(string serviceName)**
  - Return relations for specific service
  - Include both incoming and outgoing relationships

- [ ] **UpdateService(ServiceNode service)**
  - Create or update service basic information
  - Generate GUID for new services
  - Update metadata timestamps

- [ ] **UpdateServiceEndpoints(string serviceName, ServiceEndpoint[] endpoints)**
  - Update endpoints.json file
  - Validate endpoint data

- [ ] **UpdateServiceRelations(string serviceName, ServiceRelation[] relations)**
  - Update relations.json file
  - Validate relationship targets exist

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Create sample data repository for testing
- [ ] Test MCP server with Claude Code integration
- [ ] Validate all CRUD operations
- [ ] Error handling and edge cases

## Phase 2: Web API Development ðŸ”„
**Goal**: HTTP API for frontend consumption

### Backend (GraphifyCode.Api)
- [ ] Create ASP.NET Core Web API project
- [ ] Reference GraphifyCode.Core models
- [ ] Implement REST endpoints:
  - `GET /api/services` - services overview
  - `GET /api/services/{id}/endpoints`
  - `GET /api/services/{id}/relations`
  - `GET /api/graph` - complete service graph
- [ ] Add CORS configuration for frontend
- [ ] Health check endpoint
- [ ] OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

### API Features
- [ ] Service search and filtering
- [ ] Graph traversal endpoints
- [ ] Batch operations
- [ ] Data validation and error responses

## Phase 3: Frontend Development ðŸŽ¨
**Goal**: Interactive web interface for graph visualization

### Frontend (GraphifyCode.Web - Angular)
- [ ] Create Angular application structure
- [ ] Set up TypeScript models matching C# contracts
- [ ] Implement API service layer
- [ ] Design main layout and navigation

### Visualization Components
- [ ] **Service Graph Viewer**
  - Interactive node-link diagram
  - Zoom, pan, drag functionality
  - Service details on hover/click

- [ ] **Service List View**
  - Filterable table of services
  - Search by name, description
  - Status indicators

- [ ] **Service Detail View**
  - Service information display
  - Endpoints list with types
  - Relations visualization
  - Quick navigation to connected services

### Graph Library Integration
- [ ] Evaluate and choose graph library (D3.js, vis.js, cytoscape.js)
- [ ] Implement interactive graph rendering
- [ ] Add graph layout algorithms
- [ ] Export functionality (PNG, SVG, PDF)

## Phase 4: Advanced Features ðŸš€
**Goal**: Enhanced functionality and user experience

### Analytics & Insights
- [ ] Service dependency analysis
- [ ] Dead endpoint detection
- [ ] Circular dependency detection
- [ ] Service coupling metrics
- [ ] Architecture complexity metrics

### Data Management
- [ ] Import/export functionality
- [ ] Data versioning and history
- [ ] Backup and restore
- [ ] Multi-environment support

### Integration Features
- [ ] Git integration for automatic updates
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline templates
- [ ] Webhook support for real-time updates
- [ ] API documentation generation

## Phase 5: Documentation & Deployment ðŸ“š
**Goal**: Production-ready solution with comprehensive documentation

### Documentation
- [ ] User guide for teams
- [ ] MCP integration tutorial
- [ ] API reference documentation
- [ ] Architecture decision records
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide

### Deployment & Distribution
- [ ] Docker images for all components
- [ ] Kubernetes manifests
- [ ] Helm charts
- [ ] Release automation
- [ ] Update mechanism

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Unit tests for all components
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Accessibility compliance

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **Data Storage**: File-based JSON (git-friendly)
- **Service Identification**: GUID-based directories
- **MCP Integration**: Environment variable configuration
- **Frontend Framework**: Angular with TypeScript
- **Graph Visualization**: TBD (Phase 3)

### Constraints & Requirements
- Must work with Claude Code MCP integration
- Team collaboration through git repositories
- CI/CD friendly deployment
- Responsive web interface
- Real-time or near-real-time updates

## Success Criteria
- [ ] AI agents can analyze and document microservice architectures
- [ ] Teams can visualize their service dependencies interactively
- [ ] Easy setup and integration with existing workflows
- [ ] Scalable to 100+ microservices
- [ ] Maintainable and extensible codebase

## Next Session Priorities
1. Complete remaining MCP server methods
2. Test end-to-end MCP integration
3. Begin Web API development
4. Create sample data for testing
